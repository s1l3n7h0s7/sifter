# Sifter
s1l3nt78
<br>
* *Because the first step, is enumeration*
<br>
<br>
Sifter is a osint, recon & vulnerability scanner. It combines a plethara of tools within different module sets in order to quickly perform recon tasks, check network firewalling, enumerate remote and local hosts, and scan for the 'blue' vulnerabilities within microsft and if unpatched, exploit them.  It uses tools like blackwidow and konan for webdir enumeration and attack surface mapping rapidly using ASM.
<br>
Gathered info is saved to the results folder, these output files can be easily parsed over to <a href="https://github.com/s1l3nt78/TigerShark">TigerShark</a> in order to be utilised within your campaign. Or compiled for a final report to wrap up a penetration test.

<br>
<a href="https://youtu.be/QgAfqbxqbK0">Demo Video</a>
<br>
Its long, but you can skip through to get the general idea. Most modules are explained along with demos of a lot of the tools
<br>
<br>
NOTE!! IF A SCAN DOESN'T WORK PLEASE ENTER TARGET WITHOUT http:// protocol ADDED!!
<br>
<br>
eg. target.com
<br>
instead of http://target.com
<br>
<br>
# Please, if you fork this repo ensure to keep it updated.
<br>
	** Frequently updated
	<br>
	** Looking for a developer to help incorporate more offensive modules for exploitation, along side the recon.
